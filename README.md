# World Chain Builder

The World Vhain Builder is a custom block builder for the OP Stack that provides Priority Blockspace for Humans (PBH). PBH enables verified World ID users to execute transactions with top of block priority, enabling a more frictionless user experience. This mechanism is designed to ensure that ordinary users arenâ€™t unfairly disadvantaged by automated systems and greatly mitigates the impact of negative impacts of MEV. PBH also enables future flexibility, allowing for a separate EIP-1559-style fee market mechanism for verified transactions.

To learn more about how PBH works, check out the docs detailing [the PBH Transaction Lifecycle](world-chain-builder/docs/pbh_tx_lifecycle.md) as well as [World's blog post covering World Chain's builder architecture](https://world.org/blog/engineering/introducing-pbh-priority-blockspace-for-humans).
