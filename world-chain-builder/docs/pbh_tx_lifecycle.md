# Lifecycle of a PBH Transaction

The WorldChain Builder is a custom block builder for the OP Stack that provides Priority Blockspace for Humans (PBH). PBH enables verified World ID users to execute transactions with top of block priority, enabling a more frictionless user experience. This mechanism is designed to ensure that ordinary users arenâ€™t unfairly disadvantaged by automated systems and greatly mitigates the impact of negative impacts of MEV. PBH also enables future flexibility, allowing for a separate EIP-1559-style fee market mechanism for verified transactions.

The builder introduces a new [EIP-2718 RLP encoded transaction envelope](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) including the necessary data to verify the transaction was created by a valid World ID user. To get a deeper understanding of PBH, lets walk through the life cycle of a transaction. 


## Creating a PBH transaction

The contents of the PBH transaction envelope simply consists of an [Ethereum typed transaction ](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) and optional semaphore proof, ensuring that the sender is verified World ID user. In order to create a PBH transaction envelope, first generate an [Ethereum transaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/).

Next, [create a World ID proof](), **setting the `signal` to the transaction hash of the tx you are verifying**, and set the `externalNullifier` to the following schema `vv-mmyyyy-nn` where:

- **Version Prefix (vv)**: Indicates the version of the external nullifier schema This should be set to `0`.
- **Date (mmyyyy)**: Indicates the current month and year.
- **PBH Nonce (nn)**: A `u16` value used to rate-limit PBH transactions. 

Upon receiving the PBH transaction envelope, the World Chain Builder first validates the inner Ethereum transaction and then verifies the PBH payload. The builder enforces a transaction limit for each verified user that resets every month (eg. 50 txs per month), tracked by the PBH nonce specified in the `externalNullifier`. The user creating the PBH envelope must track which nonces they have used, however nonces can be specified in any order. For example, a user could send a PBH tx envelope with a PBH nonce of `16`, followed by a PBH nonce of `10` and so on. Additional transaction validation will be covered further in a later section. 

Below is a quick look at the `PbhTxEnvelope` in its entirety.

```
PbhTxEnvelope = { Tx, PbhPayload }
PbhPayload = { externalNullifier, nullifierHash, root, proof }
```
- `Tx`: Any valid Ethereum typed transaction.
- `externalNullifier`: String identifier used to ensure the uniqueness and proper sequencing of PBH transactions formatted as: `vv-mmyyyy-nn`.

- `nullifierHash`: Hash of the identity nullifier and the external nullifier; used to prevent double-signaling. You can read more [about the nullifier and external nullifier here](https://docs.world.org/world-id/further-reading/protocol-internals#external-nullifier).

- `root`: Root of the [Merkle tree representing the identity set](https://docs.world.org/world-id/further-reading/protocol-internals#signup-sequencer). This is the root used when creating the inclusion proof necessary to create a semaphore ZK proof.

- `proof`: The semaphore proof verifying that the sender is a member of the identity set.


## Sending the transaction to the Builder

Since the PBH tx envelope is a valid [EIP-2718 Typed Transaction Envelope](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), it can be sent to the builder via the `eth_sendRawTransaction` endpoint, just like any other node that implements the Engine API. 

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_sendRawTransaction\",\"params\":[\"$PBH_TX_BYTES\"],\"id\":480}" \
     $BUILDER_ENDPOINT
```



## Transaction Validation
// NOTE: PBH transactions are not gossiped or forwarded to the sequencer. All normal transactions are forwarded though


## Transaction Priority and Block Production

// NOTE: mention max gas %
